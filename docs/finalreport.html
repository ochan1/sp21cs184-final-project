  <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    In our project, we decided to implement portals. A portal can have many different uses or definitions, but
    for this project,
    we took inspiration from the popular video game series developed by Valve, Portal and Portal 2. Here, portals are
    essentially an open doorway that transports you to a different location or environment.
    They also allow you to peer into the environment as seen by the other portal, without needing to actually enter it.
    Our overall goals for this project include experimenting with ray tracing and ray cast rendering for the 3D
    objects in the scene. We wanted to see
    how the portals would handle rendering these objects and how they would look. We also wanted to implement
    teleportation to experiment with manipulating the player's position.
    Furthermore, we wanted to make the portals more vibrant than just a simple projection of what is seen by the other
    portal. We also wanted to inject more life into the scene. Because of this, we implemented a couple of custom
    shaders
    and applied them to the portal and to 3D objects.
  </p>

  <h2 id="techapproach">Technical Approach</h2>
  <!-- TODO: Bullet 1 - Oscar-->
  <h3>Portal Placement</h3>
  <p>
    The portal placement is calculated by casting a ray from where the player clicks. We check for collisions
    from the ray to an object. If the ray collides with an object, then we place a portal down on the object with a
    slight offset, so that the portal does not get buried in the object.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the portal placement is targeted on a portal, the portal will not be placed. However, our current implementation
    does allow portals to overlap if targeted right next to the portal, which may cause the portals looks to mix
    together.
  </p>
  <img class="result" src="images/finalreport/raycasting.png" />

  <p>
    The left mouse button spawns the orange portal, while the right mouse button spawns the blue portal.
    The portals are deactivated and hidden at the start, then activated at the first click of either.
    If a portal has already spawned in the scene, it will despawn from the original location and respawn to the new
    location.
  </p>
  <img class="result" src="images/finalreport/both_portals.png" />

  <h3>Portal Viewing</h3>
  <p>
    For being able to see through the portals, we employ a couple of camera tricks. We have two cameras set up, one for
    each portal. Each of these cameras relays what they are viewing to its partner portal. We must
    update both camera's position in relation to the player's position. This works by flipping the portal camera's and
    positioning the camera to the inverse of the player's current position. We must then rotate the camera afterwards.
    This allows us to maintain a nice view in each portal that does not look disjointed.
  </p>
  <img class="result" src="images/finalreport/portal_cameras.png" />
  <p>
    The math for one portal's camera can be summarized using the following matrix multiplication
    formula:
    $$ C_{portalCam} = P_{out} T_{yaxis\_180\_flip} P_{in}^{-1} C_{player} $$
    where:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      \(C_{portalCam}\) - The world space portal camera coordinates
    </li>
    <li>
      \(P_{out}\) - The local coordinate space to world coordinate
      space transformation matrix, in terms of the other portal different from the one being looked at.
      In other words, sends <strong>out</strong> the ray tracing from the in portal.
    </li>
    <li>
      \(T_{yaxis\_180\_flip}\) - Flips the camera around by 180 degrees so the transformed object is behind the portal.
    </li>
    <li>
      \(P_{in}\) - The local coordinate space to world coordinate
      space transformation matrix, in terms of the portal being looked at.
      In other words, sends <strong>in</strong> the ray tracing to the out portal.
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We use the inverse of this matrix to create a conversion of the camera's world coodinate to the
        "in" portal's local coordinates.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      \(C_{player}\) - The world coordinates of the Player Camera
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Portals Teleportation</h3>
  <p>
    When the player enters the portal, it should teleport them to the other portal. Our implementation uses a collider to
    detect when the player touches the portal and then teleports the player to the other portal, while keeping the orientation
    of the player.
  </p>
  <p>
    When teleporting the player through the portal, two things are calculated: position and rotation.
  </p>
  <p>
    For position, we take the player's coordinates in terms of the entry portal and transform that to the destination portal
    with a small forward offset applied.
  </p>
  <p>
    The math for calculating the player's teleported position can be summarized using the following matrix multiplication
    formula:
    $$ O_{position\_inportal} = P_{in}^{-1} O_{prev} $$
    $$ smallFwdOffset = {teleportOffset} * {outPortal\_forward\_vector} $$
    $$ O_{new} = P_{out} O_{position\_inportal} + smallFwdOffset $$
    where:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      \(O_{prev}\) - The world space portal camera coordinates, before teleport
    </li>
    <li>
      \(P_{in}\) - The local coordinate space to world coordinate
      space transformation matrix, in terms of the portal being looked at.
    </li>
    <li>
      \(O_{position\_inportal}\) - The position relative to the in-portal local coordinates
    </li>
    <li>
      teleportOffset - a offset multiplier to move the player in front of the portal to avoid
      repeated collision and clipthrough with portal
    </li>
    <li>
      outPortal_forward_vector - the 3D Unit Vector that defines the front face direction of the portal
    </li>
    <li>
      \(P_{out}\) - The local coordinate space to world coordinate
      space transformation matrix, in terms of the other portal different from the one being looked at.
    </li>
    <li>
      \(O_{new}\) - The new position of the player
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Recursive Portals</h3>
  <p>
    We create recursive portals by rendering a subportal by
  </p>

  <h3>Object Shaders on Portals and Objects</h3>
  <p>The equation we used for the Blinn-Phong shader:
    $$L = (k_a * I_a) + (k_d * (I /r^2) * max(0, n * l)) + (k_s * (I/r^2) * max(0, n * h) ^ p)$$
  </p>
  <p>
    For the shaders, we apply what we learned in project 4 to create a Blinn-Phong Unlit Shader. We have also created a
    surface shader that wraps objects in light. We first calculate a Fresnel coefficient by taking the dot product of
    the view direction and the normal of the object's vertex. ka, kd, and ks are the ambiance, diffuse, and spectural
    coefficients respectively.
    I/r^2 is the irradiance from the light source to the vertex we are sampling. n is the normal of the point and l is
    the magnitude of the light source to the vertex.
  </p>
  <p>
    The formula used to determine the Fresnel term is:
    $$R = max(0, min(1, bias + scale * (1.0 + I \cdot N) * power))$$
  </p>
  <p>
    We then raise it to a power that is tuned manually. We linearly interpolate the texture
    and emission color using this coefficient and set our object's emission equal to that. This works well for
    spherical/cylindrical objects with smooth, round edges, but not as well for shapes such as planes or cubes.
    You can see the result of this work applied to the capsule of the scene.
  </p>
  <p>
    We implemented a second emissive shader that gives each of the portals a glowing orange or blue rim that becomes
    lighter towards the center of the portal. We find the distance between the center of the object and each vertex, and
    use this distance to interpolate between different emitted colors. This shader works well for flat-faced objects
    like planes and cubes.
  </p>


  <h3>Problems Encountered</h3>
  <!-- TODO: Raymond Bullet 2 - Problems Encountered: 
      1. Ashley and Daniel's Shader problem - incorrect shader (unlit shader vs. surface shader)
      2. Portal Teleportation wouldn't teleport issue - resolved through FixedUpdate
      3. Portal Lag problem
      4. Portal flipping issue
      5. Portal recursive issue - camera perspective not correct for sub portals, had to reassign camera reference
  -->
  <p>
    One problem we encountered when implementing the glowing fresnel shader was that we wanted to apply a similar
    appearance to the portals, but the effect carried over poorly from the capsule to the flat portal plane. The fresnel
    shader was effective on round capsules because the glowing effect becomes more pronounced as the surface gradually
    curves away from the viewer. However, because portals are flat and generally face the player directly, the fresnel
    shader had little effect on the appearance of the portals. To resolve this, we implemented a second shader for
    portals that uses UV coordinates to detect proximity to an edge and adjust emitted color accordingly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another problem overall was the lack of resources on how to write unity shaders. Many of the online examples of
    shaders we wanted to implement or tried to gain inspiration from were done using
    the built in shader lab in unity. They didn't provide any equations that they used to base their shader off of.
    Since we wanted to code up the shader to practice what we learned in project 4, it made things difficult. Even in
    tutorials that had well defined equations,
    such as the Blinn-Phong shader, we struggled due to lack of documentation. We weren't sure what parameters were
    needed and what types they were, which made the simple Blinn Phong shader a lot harder to implement. We did get help
    from Mark Zhang for shaders, bless his soul and sorry Mark for all the questions, but all the other issues we ran
    into
    caused us to only be able to implement three shaders in total. It's a bit disappointing we couldn't implement more,
    but regardless we are still happy and proud with what we accomplished.
  </p>

  <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
  <!-- TODO: Raymond Bullet 3 - Description of lessons learned -->

  <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
  <!-- TODO: Ashley -->
  <p>
    Our final interactive portals demo is linked below. We have implemented an interactive, real-time 3D portal
    simulation in Unity, where the first-person player can move around the scene using WASD keys and place portals on
    surfaces by
    left or right clicking. The player can teleport between portals by walking through them. Recursive portal images can
    be seen when they are placed facing each other.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also implemented a variety of shaders to enhance the appearance of the scene. For round objects like capsules and
    spheres, we created a glowing fresnel shader that takes in the surface normal and the view direction, and increases
    brightness closer to the outer edges of the object. The result is a glowing appearance, regardless of the angle the
    object is viewed from.
  </p>
  <p>For the orange and blue edges of the portals, we implemented a shader that gradually shifts the emitted color as it
    approaches the edge of the portal face.</p>
  <a href="https://ashz.itch.io/cs184-portals">Interactive demo</a>

    WASD to move, left/right click to place portals. If the cursor is off-center or behaving abnormally, press Esc and
    then click within the Unity player to realign the cursor with the mouse. Chrome is recommended.
