  <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
  <p>
    First, we render an image with portals that show views from different locations in the scene.
    Then, as a stretch goal, we will make an interactive demo showcasing real-time ray tracing and collisions with
    portal placing ability using hardware acceleration like Vulkan, CUDA, or OpenGL.
  </p>

  <h2 id="problemdescription">Problem Description</h2>
  <p>
    We want to render the science fiction phenomena of <i>portals</i>.
    A portal is like an open doorway where the other side leads to 
    somewhere else. When the camera looks into portal A, the environment 
    outside of the camera's field of view as seen by portal B is
    projected onto portal A, which is within the camera's field of view.
  </p>
  <p>
    We hope to accomplish this with raytracing so that effects
    such as illumination and object rendering from a different place
    carry over between the portals.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this project, we are mainly interested in experimenting with ray tracing between
    two scenes, inside and outside the field of view. We also want to examine how
    illumination from one portal will carry over through the other.
  </p>

  <!-- TODO: Decide on framework to use after TA meeting on April 6 -->
  <p>A challenge we will likely face in meeting our initial goal is learning how to
    use new technologies (e.g. Vulkan, CUDA, OpenCL, or OpenGL)
    to accelerate raytracing and portals. A difficulty we will face in meeting our
    stretch goal is learning how to use a game engine to implement a movable character,
    and implementing real-time raytracing to adapt to the player's changing field of view.
  </p>

  <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
  <p>
    Our initial goal for this project is to create an image render of
    a static scene containing a pair of portals using ray tracing. We will 
    implement it such that the portals support global illumination where light 
    that passes through one portal comes out the other portal and lights up the scene.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we have time, our stretch goal is to add the ability to control a character
    to move around the scene and pass through the portals if possible.
    Adding character controls would require us to
    implement real-time raytracing as the character changes the angle
    and field of view it sees through a portal.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will measure our implementation by its scene rendering speeds at high resolution.
    We will also be focusing on the quality of the lighting effects and portal perspective
    passing through one portal and coming out of the other. It should look seamless and 
    visually appealing.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is achievable because we are building off of the rendering framework of project 3 
    and we have a clear understanding of how we will represent and render portals.

  <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
  <h3>MVP Initial Deliverables</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Create a static renderer that can render a scene with portals.
      The scene will be encoded as a COLLADA dae extended with a new portal "material".
    </li>
    <li>
      Have a global illumination effect, where the light rays intersecting
      with a portal will go out through to the other portal and light up the scene.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ensure that the perspective of the scene viewed through a portal is
      consistent, regardless of camera position or angle relative to the portal.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create a variety of scenes (DAE meshes) containing portals to render images with.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Stretch Deliverables</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Modify the shape of the portal.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make it real time and interactive by allowing the user to move the camera (or other objects) and pass through the portals.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the ability place portals wherever in real time.
    </li>
  </ul>
