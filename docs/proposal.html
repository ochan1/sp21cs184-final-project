  <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
  <p>
    First, we render an image with portals that show views from different locations in the scene.
    Then, as a stretch goal, we will make an interactive demo showcasing real-time ray tracing and collisions with
    portal placing ability using a game engine like Unity.
  </p>

  <h2 id="problemdescription">Problem Description</h2>
  <p>
    We want to render the science fiction phenomena of <i>portals</i>.
    A portal is like an open doorway where the other side leads to
    somewhere else. When the camera looks into portal A, the environment
    outside of the camera's field of view as seen by portal B is
    projected onto portal A, which is within the camera's field of view.
  </p>
  <p>
    We hope to accomplish this with raytracing so that effects
    such as illumination and object rendering from a different place
    carry over between the portals.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this project, we are mainly interested in experimenting with ray tracing between
    two scenes, inside and outside the field of view. We also want to examine how
    illumination from one portal will carry over through the other.
  </p>

  <!-- Done: Decide on framework to use after TA meeting on April 6 -->
  <!-- Use Unity, which incorporates graphics card functionality for us -->
  <p>
    A challenge we will likely face in meeting our initial goal is learning how to
    use new technologies (Unity3D) to implement portals.
  </p>

  <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
  <p>
    Our initial goal for this project is to recreate in Unity the visual effect of
    looking through a portal at another area in the
    scene, out of view to the player in first person perspective.
    The player should be able to move around the scene and
    see the view through the portal update according to the player's position and angle relative to the portal.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we have time, our stretch goal is to add the ability for the player to pass through the portals. The player
    should transition smoothly between the portals with no sudden jumps or changes in perspective.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will focus on the quality of the lighting effects and portal perspective
    passing through one portal and coming out of the other. It should look seamless and
    visually appealing.
  </p>

  <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
  <h3>MVP Initial Deliverables</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Create a static renderer that can render a scene with portals.
      The scene will be encoded as a COLLADA dae with primitives (cubes, spheres).
    </li>
    <li>
      Have a global illumination effect, where the light rays intersecting
      with a portal will through the other portal and light up the scene.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ensure that the perspective of the scene viewed through a portal is
      consistent, regardless of camera position or angle relative to the portal.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create a variety of scenes (DAE meshes and primitives in Unity) containing portals to render images.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Stretch Deliverables</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Modify the shape of the portal.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make it real time and interactive by allowing the user to move the camera (or other objects) and pass through the
      portals.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the ability place portals wherever in real time.
    </li>
  </ul>
